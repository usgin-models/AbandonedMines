AbandonedMines
==============

This content model is for delivery of abandoned underground mine features in the AASG geothermal data project. The AbandonedUndergroundMine worksheet specifies content elements for an interchange format for location, area, volume, heat capacity, temperature and other measurement data obtained for AUMs.  Fields in that spreadsheet will become XML elements in interchange documents for WFS simple features/geothermal data web services. Typically AUM data are recorded in state survey databases, and this information could be provided through an AUM observation service. The HeaderURI for a particular mine is the cross-referencing link (foreign key) used to associate the header record and other information from a particular AUM.
